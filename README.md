# haptikstellarium
This project aims to create an application that allows blind and visually disadvantaged people to experience the universe. 

We will use a sky simulator software (most likely Stellarium) to create a 3D virtual map of the sky. In this map, a number of stars above a certain brightness will be selected, as well as solar system planets and prominent deep sky objects (star clusters, galaxies and nebulae). 
Let us say that this is a smartphone application, the smartphone gyroscope data (plus compass for calibration) can be used to track the smartphone orientation, hence wherever you point your phone to; you will be pointing to a star in the real sky.
The phone will use vibration and sound attuned to the colour, brightness and diffuseness of the object in the sky to give a real feel of these objects.
The app can be used in the day, and it can also be used to feel the stars behind Earth.

The motivation for this app came when I (Yashodhan) realised that my blind hostel-mate had never experienced stars.
In the future we can think about creating a glove which lets you 'touch' the stars. It should not be difficult.
